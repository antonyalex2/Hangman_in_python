# Hangman_in_python
Through this project I have attempted to make a digital version of the popular pen and paper game,Hangman. 

Using MySQL for the backend and Python for the frontend, I've created a login system that empowers users with three distinct options:

User Registration: Newcomers can register with unique usernames and passwords, creating personalized profiles with individual game statistics.

Personalized Dashboard: Players can log in to access their personal statistics.

Guest Mode: For a quick thrill, a guest feature allows users to enjoy the game without committing to a full profile.


#HOW IT WORKS
The program takes a random word from a list of 5 letter words.
The result of the game (Win/Lose) is then updated in a MySQL database along with other Gameplay statistics and is made available to the user on demand.
